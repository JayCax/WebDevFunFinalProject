        <b>My name is John-Francis. I am an aspiring bioinformatician, computational / system biologist, and / or data sciencist</b> 
        <p>I am a graduate from the University of California, Davis with a degree in Genetics & Genomics. My dream job would be to
        fuse the realms of biology and computer science in such areas as mapping genomes, studying specific haplogroups of different human populations, 
        conduct software-based anthropological analysis on the development and spread of humanity and much more.
        <p>My initial quarters of computer science and programming has kindled within me with a passion of the subject. After much development,
        I am finally unlocking my mind to the deep concepts and a whole new way of thinking and analyzing. I hope that with hard work and 
        dedication I can really achieve some revolutionary good with my professional career be it in biology, software or a combination of both.
